## 🎨 A Design That Breaks The Mold

Feastro isn't just another food delivery website—it's a **visual experience**. We've completely reimagined what a modern food platform should look like, throwing conventional layouts out the window in favor of something truly unique.

### What Makes Feastro Special?

- **🎯 Asymmetric Bento-Box Layout** - Inspired by modern dashboard design, our hero section uses a grid-based layout where each element breathes
- **🎭 Side Navigation** - Breaking the norm with vertical navigation that keeps users oriented without dominating the screen
- **🎲 Diagonal Menu Cards** - Food items displayed at playful angles that straighten on hover, creating delightful micro-interactions
- **🌈 Bold Color Palette** - Deep purples, vibrant magentas, and electric yellows against a dark navy canvas—this isn't your typical restaurant site
- **✨ Animated Background Shapes** - Floating gradient blobs that add depth and movement without distraction

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

### 1. **Asymmetry Creates Interest**
We deliberately broke the grid to create visual tension. The bento-box layout means each section has its own space, its own purpose, and its own personality.

### 2. **Bold Colors Tell Stories**
Our purple-to-magenta gradients aren't just pretty—they signal premium quality. The yellow CTAs demand attention. The dark background makes food photography pop.

### 3. **Micro-Interactions Matter**
Every hover, every click, every scroll has been carefully choreographed. The diagonal cards that straighten? The gradient borders that glow? These details separate good from great.

### 4. **Mobile-First, Always**
Responsive isn't optional—it's the foundation. Every element adapts gracefully from 320px phones to 4K displays.

## 🎨 Color Palette

```css
--background:     #1a1a2e    /* Dark Navy */
--primary:        #6C3CDB    /* Deep Purple */
--accent:         #D946A0    /* Vibrant Magenta */
--highlight:      #FFD93D    /* Electric Yellow */
--card-bg:        rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)  /* Frosted Glass */
```

hover → translateY(-10px);          /* Lifts for emphasis */
```
